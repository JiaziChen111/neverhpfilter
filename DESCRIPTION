Description: In the working paper titled "Why You Should Never Use the Hodrick-Prescott Filter",
   James D. Hamilton and  his trusty research assistant Daniel Leff, propose a more
   robust approach to filtering. By regresing the variable at date t+h on the four 
   most recent values as of date t, all the objectives sought by users of the 
   Hodrick-Prescott Filter are met, with none of its drawbacks. Hamilton (2017)
