Description: In the working paper titled "Why You Should Never Use the 
    Hodrick-Prescott Filter", James D. Hamilton and his trusty research assistant 
    Daniel Leff, propose a more robust approach to economic time series filtering. 
    By regressing the variable at date t+h on the four most recent values as of date
    t, all the objectives sought by users of the Hodrick-Prescott Filter are met, 
    with none of its drawbacks. Hamilton (2017) <doi:10.3386/w23429>
