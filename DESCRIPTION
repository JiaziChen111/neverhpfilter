Description: In their working paper titled "Why You Should Never Use the 
    Hodrick-Prescott Filter", James D. Hamilton proposes a more robust approach to 
    economic time series filtering. The `neverHPfilter` package implements his approach.
    By regressing the y variable at date T+h on the four most recent lagged values 
    of a quarterly time series as of date t, all the objectives sought by users of 
    the Hodrick-Prescott Filter are met, with none of its drawbacks.
