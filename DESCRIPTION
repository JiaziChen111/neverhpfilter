Description: In the working paper titled "Why You Should Never Use the Hodrick-Prescott Filter",
  James D. Hamilton proposes an approach to economic time series filtering which achieves 
  goals the HP-Filter attempts, but ultimately does not produce. The `neverhpfilter` 
  package implements his approach. Hamilton (2017) <doi:10.3386/w23429>.
