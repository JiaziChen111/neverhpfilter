Description: In his working paper titled "Why You Should Never Use the 
  Hodrick-Prescott Filter", James D. Hamilton proposes an alternative approach to 
  economic time series filtering. The `neverHPfilter` package implements his approach.
  By fitting a Generalized Linear Model of the y variable at date t+h on the p most 
  lagged values of an time series, all the objectives sought by users of the 
  Hodrick-Prescott filter are met, with none of its drawbacks. Hamilton (2017)
