Description: In his working paper titled "Why You Should Never Use the 
    Hodrick-Prescott Filter", James D. Hamilton proposes a more robust approach to 
    economic time series filtering. The `neverHPfilter` package implements the approach.
    By regressing the y variable at date t+h on p most recent lagged values 
    of a quarterly time series, all the objectives sought by users of the Hodrick-Prescott 
    Filter are met, with none of its drawbacks. Hamilton (2017) <doi:10.3386/w23429>.
